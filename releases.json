Causes SAO: Fatal Bullet to hang on start, but is incorrect. Allows Paladins and Squad to correctly contact EAC cloudflare servers (there are additional EAC issues still, but Paladins no longer crashes). See: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1787#issuecomment-655289213\r\n-Disabled Remi's memory allocation patches as they cause some funky interface lag in Overwatch\r\n\r\n--HOTFIX-- 7/6/2020 1:32 PM MST:\r\nBackported fix for: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49228 \r\nThanks Iglu47 for reminding me of this and whipping up the gofman_dac patch update that was conflicting with this.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease:\r\nAfter ironing out a lot of the major bugs since 5.11, I've realized that while some games run well enough without esync/fsync, the majority of games, specifically triple A titles, really need esync/fsync, especially when running on lower end hardware.\r\n\r\nSO, what I've done is taken -all- of the fixes from the 5.11 versions and upstream that are major/relevant that I could recall, and backported them to the 5.9 build. This returns esync/fsync functionality, and also enables some games to run correctly that weren't running in 5.11.\r\n\r\nSo yes, this is aimed as a 'STABLE' build.\r\n-All the fixes from the 5.11 releases.\r\n-esync/fsync re-enabled\r\n-MGS: Ground Zeroes fully works\r\n-Planet Zoo fully works\r\n\r\nFrom here I've created yet another branch -- proton-ge-5-stable, which I hope to backport future fixes to, and bump up once Wine gets all of its current kinks resolved. The proton-ge-5-MF branch will continue to be the upstream git branch, with major game fixes being backported to the stable branch (hopefully).\r\n\r\nI would say for now, use this as the default 'GE' build over the 5.11 builds. \r\nhttps://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/5.9-GE-3-ST"

Hangs on new game, waiting on EVR implementation in wine\r\n-Deep Rock Galactic (and other games) libffi dependency fixed that was causing various crashes -- note, please do not use steam-native if you are on arch, steam-runtime should always be used.\r\n-Protonfixes added for Assetto Corsa, should now work OOTB\r\n\r\nBuild additions:\r\n-'wmp9_x86_64' winetricks verb imported to protonfixes from upstream winetricks that allows wmp9 to be installed in 64 bit prefixes\r\n-hotfix added to use normal username instead of 'steamuser' when run with non-steam games. This also seems to fix issues with origin and other platforms not being able to save game  (such as running Jedi Fallen Order origin version in lutris with proton)\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n-dxvk updated\r\n-FAudio updated\r\n\r\nBuild removals:\r\n-Temporary removal of fshack, currently breaks MK11\r\n-Temporary removal of esync, 5.10+ did a large rework of ntdll which broke compatibility with esync. The patchset needs to be rebased. It is currently disabled in staging.\r\n-Temporary removal of fsync - fsync relies on esync. No esync = no fsync.\r\n\r\nKnown issues but playable:\r\n-MK11 - no audio in custscenes -- needs SAR fixes, online matches broken\r\n-Injustice 2 - no audio in custscenes -- needs SAR fixes\r\n-Broken sound in Borderlands 3 Marcus new game intro -- can be skipped.\r\n-Age of Empires II WMV videos don't play\r\n-Street Fighter V intro videos don't play\r\n\r\nStill broken:\r\n-Seven (hangs on new game)\r\n-Catherine (hangs on new game)\r\n-Soul Calibur VI (hangs at main menu, needs SAR fixes)\r\n-Nioh videos don't play, gameplay untested\r\n\r\nMarking this as release as it has a lot of regression fixes and should be quite stable, despite the ongoing media foundation work and esync/fsync being disabled."

    "body": "--HOTFIX-- \r\n---------------------\r\n6/10/2020 7:17 PM MST:\r\nAfter reviewing the issue tracker  again for Sea of Thieves I found via ga2mer's comments that it becomes working/playable after login if the prefix is set to Win7. I tested this and it did indeed allow me to login and get past the previous journal issue/became playable. I've added a hotfix in protonfixes that should do this automagically. Updated Proton-5.9-GE-2-MF.tar.gz again.\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n--HOTFIX-- \r\n---------------------\r\n6/10/2020 10:15 AM MST:\r\nI accidentally applied part 1 of a 2 part patch for RE3 twice instead of both 1st and 2nd parts, so I just corrected that and recompiled + reattached Proton-5.9-GE-2-MF.tar.gz. RE3 credits should work now\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nHi all, I'm marking this as another pre-release as we still have some audio issues with media foundation, and a few other pending issues, however we also have quite a few fixes:\r\n\r\n-Fullscreen hack is disabled still for compatibility with MK11.\r\n-Rawinput re-enabled\r\n-Nier/sekiro winex11 patch re-enabled\r\n-winevulkan patches re-enabled\r\n-The weird Skyrim mouse reverse input issue was fixed in 5.10, so I've backported it.\r\n-There is some heavy work being done on wined3d and dxgi, which causes some additional issues, so TOXIKK and Killer Instinct require wined3d to currently run properly. Protonfixes have been added to do that automatically, so those games both work with wined3d currently.\r\n-There is also some heavy work being done on ntdll in 5.10+, which cause esync and fsync patchsets to not be compatible. Due to this, I'm currently working with 5.9 and backporting specific changes necessary to retain esync and fsync compatibility.\r\n-A dxgi native override was also added in protonfixes so that Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain now works\r\n-A fix has been added for the RE3 credits crash - thanks vitorhnn!\r\n-A fix has been added for the MK11 and Injustice 2 video color issue - thanks vitorhnn!\r\n-A partial fix for websockets has been added for Sea of Thieves so that login now works, however it is currently crashing after login on 'Opening the Journal' - thanks ga2mer!\r\n-5.10 media foundation patches have been backported\r\n-Remi Bernon's free range memory allocation patches have been backported which increases performance in We Happy Few and some other games.\r\n-Proton 5.0.8 changes backported\r\n-DXVK updated\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n-FAudio updated\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n-Fullscreen hack still disabled for the time being to retain compatiblity with MK11\r\n-Path of Exile cannot switch to vulkan renderer when using RADV, but works with AMDVLK. This is something else tied to fullscreen hack, as patching in fullscreen hack allows it to switch. RADV currently has a lot of graphical glitches with PoE anyway, so for the time being AMDVLK is the better option to use.\r\n-Soul Calibur VI still hangs at intro due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation\r\n-Injustice 2 and MK11 cut scene audio is missing due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation\r\n-Borderlands 3 Marcus intro on new game audio is distorted due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation, but is skippable.\r\n-Seven still only plays intro audio, no video, and crashes after starting new game due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation.\r\n-libffi6 is still needed for some rolling release distros such as arch\r\n-As mentioned, due to work being done with wined3d, dxgi is in an odd state. If a game works in proton, but does not work in proton-ge, try adding `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dxgi=n %command%` to the options. If it works, let me know and I can add a protonfixes override for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently I would say this should be ok to use for most games except Soul Calibur VI and Seven"

    "body": "Hi all. This pre-release has yet more media foundation work added. I'm tagging it as a pre-release because I've had to disable some things in order for  a few new games to work.\r\n\r\n-Fullscreen hack was found to be the cause of Mortal Kombat 11 not working. This also requires a few other patches to be disabled such as some additional vulkan patches and raw input, as well as the Sekiro patch. Fullscreen hack used to work with this game, so this is just a temporary disable until I can figure out what in the patchset is causing MK11 to not work.\r\n-Spyro audio is fully working now\r\n-BL3 Markus intro has audio issues still but is skippable\r\n-Soul Calibur VI freezes at the intro screen currently due to an issue with SAR audio. \r\n-Seven actually launches now. Audio for intro movie plays but shows black screen. New game results in crash, again due to SAR audio.\r\n-PC Building Simulator no longer freezes when running 3dmark on low settings. It just skips the video.\r\n\r\nThis is -very- much a pre-release specifically for MK11. With MK11's new expansion just released I wanted to get this out there because it not only allows MK11 to run with gamepad support, but also Injustice 2. \r\n\r\nI have not tested, but from other sources I'm informed MK11's online mode still does -not- currently work. \r\n\r\nI did not test online modes, But offline modes in both games did work with gamepad support.\r\n![Screenshot_20200527_211055](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287837/83094297-9f683c80-a05e-11ea-81c8-ba08eff13b6f.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20200527_200928](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287837/83093452-b6a62a80-a05c-11ea-9594-5a93a1e156ef.png)\r\n\r\nAs of right now, the most stable version is still 5.8-GE-2-MF. This pre-release is mainly for MK and other Netherrealm Studios games.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to junaru for finding disabling fshack fixes the issue and pnevmoslon for the controller fix on the TKG's issue tracker.\r\n"

    "body": "Hi All, So originally I was going to do a double release -- one with the media foundation work, and one without, however with much of the media foundation work already upstreamed, I'm not able to do that without reverting a large amount of the commits. On the bright side, a lot of the media foundation work that has been done and is  currently in alpha testing, is getting to a good working state. \r\n\r\nMany of the media foundation games don't work to begin with in the first place in proton, or if they do, they work in normal proton due to the previously used media foundation hacks to disable it. These hacks conflict with upstream and no longer work as mentioned, without reverting multiple commits.\r\n\r\nBased on this moving forward my builds will include the media foundation patches. If you come across a game that works in normal proton, but does not work in my build, chances are it has a media foundation issue.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I do feel this build is quite stable, and has had a lot of fixes implemented which get many previously non-working games into a working state, as well as fixing quite a few bugs between 5.6 and 5.7.\r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\n\r\nI forgot to also mention I've added an updated version of the dxvk async patch which allows async pipelines to work with the state cache (previous version did not). Again, use at your own risk. As far as I'm aware, this is safe to use on Path of Exile and Warframe. \r\n\r\nFor those unaware - the async patch is a feature that was in DXVK, but was removed because around the same time, people started receiving bans in overwatch. Since async came out around the same time, it was blamed and thus removed from dxvk, however in some games it provides a significant performance increase. This is why I reiterate -- use at your own risk. It can be enabled with DXVK_ASYNC=1 %command% in the steam game launch options.\r\n\r\nOverall fixes:\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n-Fix for https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/2929 added, fixes crash in Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Nier: Automata\r\n-GTA IV should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton\r\n-Street Fighter V should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton\r\n-HideWineExports=Y registration added for FFXIV, fixes license issue\r\n-Homeworld Remastered Collection should be playable without custom launcher necessary\r\n-Updated steep patch for wine 5.8\r\n-fixed proton controller patch issues -- should now have full proton controller patchset and functionality to match upstream proton\r\n-patch added that fixes overwatch breakage in 5.7\r\n-patch added that fixes star citizen breakage in 5.7\r\n-patch added that fixes Path of Exile flicker in 5.7\r\n-FFXV patch is now working again, game should be playable\r\n-Monster Hunter World patches added which enable DX12 mode with vkd3d\r\n-DXVK async patch updated and re-added. Disabled by default, used DXVK_ASYNC=1 %command% to enable.\r\n\r\nMF (Media Foundation) specific fixes:\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n-Resident Evil 2 videos fixed, should now be fully playable, also works in DX12/vkd3d\r\n-Spyro Reignited Trilogy videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Remnant: From the Ashes videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Soul Calibur VI videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Street Fighter V videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Deep Rock Galactic videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-BlazBlue Centralfiction videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Bloodstained: Ritual of the night intro videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n-Crazy Machines 3 videos fixed, should now be fully playable\r\n\r\nWIP (work in progress) and known issues:\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n-Deep Rock Galactic requires libffi. Most distros ship this, with libffi.so.6, however some rolling distros such as Arch have upgraded to libffi.so.7.1.0, causing breakage. On arch this can be fixed by installing the `libffi6` package from the AUR.\r\n-Resident Evil 3 crashes at  rpd bathroom c4 detonation scene\r\n-Borderlands 3 New Game Marcus narrated intro still crashes\r\n-Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid works, however cutscene audio plays in what can only be described as \"chipmunk mode\", lol.\r\n-Seven: Enhanced Edition Intro Video hangs (uses MPEG1 format, needs to be implemented)\r\n-Age of Empires II WMV videos don't play\r\n-Darksiders: Warmastered Edition wmv videos do not play\r\n-Catherine Classic does not play, opens small black box for game window\r\n-Danganronpa V3 crashes on opening\r\n"

    "body": "-This is a hotfix that reverts the fullscreen hack changes, as they introduced a regression with mouse stutter on movement after a period of time. What this means:\r\n-Fullscreen hack is still enabled, it's just using proton's version, not customized for staging\r\n-Staging's winex11.drv-mouse-coorrds and rawinput patchsets have been disabled\r\n-Proton's rawinput patchset has been re-enabled.\r\n\r\nNormally I'd wait to release smaller changes like this, but the regression made some games basically unplayable. This should allow games to be played at least without the mouse stutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: 4/14:\r\n-The cause of RE2 crashing in DX12 has been found. Mesa overlay causes it to crash. If you have the Mesa vulkan overlay enabled, remove the launch options/disable it and it should allow RE2 to not crash in DX12/vkd3d mode. This should make both RE2 and RE3 fully playable in DX12/vkd3d. I have not tested the STARS office scene in RE3, so if someone could confirm that's working it'd be appreciated."

This fixes the issue with sometimes having to hit the play button twice, or some issues people have on their system where the dist tarball never extracts.\r\n-fullscreen hack patches modified to work with staging's winex11.drv-mouse-coorrds and rawinput patch sets\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-Spyro is still broken\r\n-MHW Tutorials are still broken\r\n-BL3 usually wants to set Direct12, which crashes. This generally leads to a popup asking you to restore default settings (confirm/hit `yes`).  You will then need to relaunch the game and go in the games settings and change it to DirectX11 manually. After that DirectX11 should stick as the default mode.\r\n-RE2 Crashes in DX12 with vkd3d  at main menu, you'll need to set `DirectX11` in re2_config.ini for DX11 with DXVK\r\n-RE3 Seems to work with DX12 and vkd3d with minor interface graphical glitches. Can set `DirectX11` in re3_config.ini for DX11 with DXVK\r\n-FFXV seems to be working again\r\n\r\nAgain, I must note that 'pre-release' builds are basically alpha-testing builds. While they may contain a lot of fixes, some things may also be broken that normally are not.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in this regard - proton normally disables 'mfplay' which allows media foundation movies in many games (WMV and MP4) to just be skipped automatically. Since we enable this without full functionality, some games, such as Spyro or MHW, may hang when a movie tries to play.  \r\n\r\nIf you wish to re-disable media foundation to use this version with your other games, you can use `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=mfplay=n %command%` in the game's launch options.\r\n"

A huge thank you goes to Derek Lesho (Guy1524: https://github.com/Guy1524/wine) as well as Nikolay Sivov and Sergio Gómez Del Real all from CodeWeavers for getting this stuff working and taking the time to help me get it working with the correct dependencies in proton. \r\n\r\nWhat this does is allows mp4 playback in MANY titles, including UE4 -and- Unity engine games. This fixes a lot (not all, but a lot) of issues surrounding media foundation/mfplat without the need for the 'mf-install' workaround that has legal issues and limitations, and is much safer for us to ship.\r\n\r\nTested fixes:\r\n-Fixed borderlands 3 lilith in-head videos and 'watch the monitor' video bug\r\n-Fixes Remnant: From the Ashes intro videos, intro menu, character menu\r\n-Fixes intro video on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\r\n-Fixes mp4 playback issues related to Crazy Machines 3\r\n\r\nStill broken:\r\n-Borderlands 3 intro narrative with Marcus's voice on new game does not play\r\n-Spyro is still broken\r\n-Probably some other mp4 related titles\r\n\r\nAdditional updates:\r\n-A small patch has been added that should fix sunset overdrive from crashing on launch: https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/182631\r\n-Two warframe launcher regressions have been fixed\r\n-Mouse input fix patches which were added to wine-staging for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36873\r\n-Lots of gstreamer plugin related work has been done/added in order to get media foundation stuff working. This was also cleared with aeikum and kisak from Valve personally, and deemed -ok- to include in my repository. This means it is safe to continue to link in Valve's issue trackers, unlike the 'mf-install' workaround. HURRAY!\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n-Not -all- mp4s are fixed. There are still some that have problematic formats that are being worked on.\r\n-Also coming down the pipe soon will be WMV playback fixes. This is to be handled after the mp4 issues are sorted.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the Borderlands 3 'Watch the Monitor' quest working finally, woo! --\r\n![ayy3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11287837/78464269-a0a36b80-76a4-11ea-8988-51d3ef12757e.png)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n "

I spent the weekend debugging it and was finally able to come up with a bit of a hacky workaround, but it works for now until valve addresses the issue (it has to do with the way lsteamclient handles controllers)\r\n\r\nFeature:\r\n-vkd3d branch is latest from codeweavers + DXIL changes by Hans Kristian (who has been doing a lot of vkd3d submissions) + metro exodus commits that both Hans and Doitsujin (creator of dxvk) have been working on together. The previous release had Hans's DXIL changes, this just adds the Metro changes on top of it. With that being said, expect some minor graphical glitches in vkd3d with Metro Exodus\r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\n-This commit: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/pull/3518 has been merged. This was a previous open PR from Guy1542, but it had a bug that would cause clustertruck and a few others not to launch. The new PR is by joshie (d9vk dev) and works now\r\n\r\n-dxvk update to latest git\r\n-faudio updated to latest git\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n-Just Cause 3 not able to save\r\n-Batman Arkham Knight grappling hook not working\r\n-MK11 hanging at launch  (again)"

No launch options necessary, winedebug disabled via protonfixes which allows multiplayer to work\r\n-Halo MCC login fixed, allows single player to be played\r\n-DXVK Async has been completely removed. After some discussion after the last release, the author of dxvk, who was also the author of the original async patch has stated it is outdated, and requested it not be used so that to prevent confusion in bug reports and make debugging and fixing things within dxvk easier in the future. This allows bug reports using proton-ge to be more acceptable in terms of DXVK graphical debugging\r\n-PROTON_NO_D3D11,PROTON_NO_D3D10,PROTON_NO_D9VK options have all been removed, because the option PROTON_USE_WINED3D does the same thing for all 3 of these options.\r\n-Proton's gamepad additions patchset has been disabled for the time being, and staging's dinput patches have been re-enabled. I've been informed currently wine-staging handles gamepads a bit better than proton's gamepad additions, so I'll need more feedback on this change.\r\n-FAudio, dxvk, d9vk, vkd3d updated\r\n-FAudio's updates have some additional work regarding xWMA audio format, which is used in warframe. This may allow for less frequent audio crashes, if any.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n-There seems to be a small pre-existing issue with alt-tabbing out of GTA 5 that forces the player on character select/record video. you can just hit f1 to toggle video recording to continue playing.\r\n"

    "body": "This build is a bit of a replacement for the previous builds which have now been removed. I've had some hit or miss troubles getting this build to a stable point that I wanted it, but all the standard games that worked before without mfplat should work fine. This should serve as a solid base moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe mf_install verb in protonfixes has been altered. I have removed the mf plat related files and registry entries which are not publicly available directly from Microsoft. I have also removed previously released builds that contained these files. There are two reasons for me doing this:\r\n\r\n-The first, is that I wish for this project to stay within legal boundaries that allow it to be shared within Valve's proton bug trackers. The goal of my project is to help progress proton, therefore I do not wish to induce limits which would cause it to be moderated or banned from their bug tracker.\r\n\r\n-The second, is that distribution of Microsoft libraries beyond Microsoft doing so directly, is illegal. Therefore I've removed those libraries from the mf_install verb's download list, and the corresponding registry entries. The only ones which remain are the ones which are supplied by Microsoft directly and are publicly available via KB976932.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\n-fixed fullscreen hack to work with downscaling such as vanilla proton\r\n-added fix for fullscreen hack that allows integer scaling: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/69\r\n-patches for skyrim skyui status effect icons. icons now show up.\r\n-patches for shadow of the tomb raider with vkd3d. game now runs with vkd3d again\r\n-patches for gta v rockstar launcher and game. launcher and game now function correctly\r\n-patches for origin downloads regression fix. origin should now download games and verify existing installed games (mostly) properly.\r\n-adds stub so that star wars jedi: fallen order works - note, I have not tested the steam verson, only the origin version.\r\n-patches for mk11 added. fixes mk11 launch crash. still needs mfplat\r\n-the mk11 patch has a new envvar which is enabled only for mk11 and skyrim se: WINE_MEM_ALLOC_MOD. This patch is problematic in some other games, so it was better to set it off by default and only enable it with an envvar. I have set the envvar automatically in protonfixes for these two games.\r\n-Fix for warhammer: chaosbane hair glitch in dxvk\r\n-Fix for warlock: master of the arcane new game freeze in d9vk\r\n-rawinput patches disabled (again), as it's currently broken (again).\r\n-re-enabled commit that fixes alt-tabbing in most desktop environments: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/commit/a8675091927c01a0c28de349517c5010557f06a9. Note, This causes the XFCE panel to appear above some games.\r\n-The spinlocks portion of the fsync patch has been removed in order to improve stability\r\n-d9vk updated\r\n-dxvk updated\r\n-faudio updated\r\n-vkd3d updated\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n-mk11 has desync issue with online matches (online matches will not work).\r\n\r\nMany games require mfplat functionality that does not come with proton or normal wine. It is very likely that without these libraries, some games will not function properly. The games that currently rely on mfplat and -may- be affected by the changes in the above mentioned \"Notice\" are:\r\n\r\n-mk11\r\n-spyro reignited trilogy\r\n-Monster Hunter World\r\n-Blaz Blue Central Fiction\r\n-GRIS\r\n-Breathedge\r\n-FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD\r\n-Car Mechanic Simulator 2018\r\n-PC Building Simulator\r\n-American Fugitive\r\n-Remnant: From the Ashes\r\n-Darksiders Warmastered Edition\r\n-Bloodstained Ritual of the Night\r\n-Age of Empires: Definitive Edition\r\n-Team Sonic Racing\r\n-Mordhau\r\n-Disgaea 5\r\n-Earth Defense Force 5\r\n-SOULCALIBUR VI\r\n-Quantum Break\r\n-Assetto Corsa Competizione\r\n-RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard\r\n-Resident Evil 4\r\n-Resident Evil 2 Remake\r\n-Blasphemous\r\n"

This will remove the progress bar and the launcher will simply say \"Checking for Content\" until it completes.\r\n```"
