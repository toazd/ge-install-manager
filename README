  Default config path:        ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-"$HOME"/.config}/ge-install-manager

  - Acceptable formats for <version>:
      5.9-GE-3-ST, Proton-5.9-GE-3-ST, Proton-5.9-GE-3-ST.tar.gz (case-insensitive)

  - Most parameters can be combined with other unique parameters.
    > NOTE: arguments must directly follow parameters that require arguments
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -Hh
        ./ge-install-manager -h -H
          Result: Show help and then show usage
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -lSui 5.9-GE-3-ST
        ./ge-install-manager -lS -i 5.9-GE-3-ST -u
          Result: Check for the latest version and install it,
           install version 5.9-GE-3-ST, list installed versions, then
           report file and disk usage for the install path
      Example: (assume the latest version is 5.9-GE-3-ST)
        ./ge-install-manager -z -u -i Proton-5.11-GE-1-MF -Xf
          Result: enable debug mode, remove the installation path,
           update to the latest version 5.9-GE-3-ST, and then install version 5.11-GE-1-MF.
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -s 5.6-GE-3-ST -S
        ./ge-install-manager -Ss 5.6-GE-3-ST
          Result: report disk usage and file count for the install path,
           and then report disk usage and file count for version 5.6-GE-3-ST

  - The order of parameters is not significant except:
    > If during invocation multiple identical parameters are supplied.
      Example:
        ./ge-install-manager -s 5.11-GE-1-MF -s 5.9-GE-3-ST
          Result: Only the right-most parameter will be processed (-s 5.9-GE-3-ST).

  - Order of operations if multiple unique parameters are supplied:
    > NOTE: -h and/or -H, and -fzZ will exit irrespective of other parameters
