Basic installation:
      Download ge-install-manager and create a symlink to it.
      Run ge-install-manager -L to list releases available to install.
      Run ge-install-manager -i <version> to install (eg. 5.9-GE-ST-8).
NOTE: If your PATH includes .local/bin a symlink will be auto-created to the script
      if it doesn't exist.

NOTE: After installing Steam, you will need to run it at least once before
      this script will detect that it is installed.

NOTE: Ubuntu users - you may need to install curl (sudo apt install curl -y).

NOTE: The script will check for all required commands and then notify you
      if any are not found.

Usage:

  Default config path:        ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-"$HOME"/.config}/ge-install-manager

  - Acceptable formats for <version> (case-insensitive):
      5.9-GE-3-ST, Proton-5.9-GE-3-ST, Proton-5.9-GE-3-ST.tar.gz

  - Most parameters can be combined with other unique parameters.
    > NOTE: arguments must directly follow parameters that require arguments
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -Hh
        ./ge-install-manager -h -H
          Result: Show help and then show usage
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -lSui 5.9-GE-3-ST
        ./ge-install-manager -lS -i 5.9-GE-3-ST -u
          Result: Check for the latest version and install it,
           install version 5.9-GE-3-ST, list installed versions, then
           report file and disk usage for the install path
      Example: (assume the latest version is 5.9-GE-3-ST)
        ./ge-install-manager -z -u -i Proton-5.11-GE-1-MF -Xf
          Result: enable verbose mode, remove the installation path,
           update to the latest version 5.9-GE-3-ST, and then install version 5.11-GE-1-MF.
      Example (both produce the same result):
        ./ge-install-manager -s 5.6-GE-3-ST -S
        ./ge-install-manager -Ss 5.6-GE-3-ST
          Result: report disk usage and file count for the install path,
           and then report disk usage and file count for version 5.6-GE-3-ST

  - The order of parameters is not significant except:
    > If during invocation multiple identical parameters are supplied.
      Example:
        ./ge-install-manager -s 5.11-GE-1-MF -s 5.9-GE-3-ST
          Result: Only the right-most parameter and argument will be processed (-s 5.9-GE-3-ST).

  - Order of operations if multiple unique parameters are supplied:
    > NOTE: -h and/or -H, and -fzZ/-fzT will exit irrespective of other parameters
